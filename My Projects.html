                <h2 style="font-style: sans-serif;"> MPG Calculator</h2>
                <p> Tools Used: Google Sheets, Google Forms, Charts & Graphs. </p>
                <p> The MPG Calculator Project was designed to help small businesses track and analyze gas expenses by comparing fuel prices across different gas companies and car models. Our team collected raw data through Google Forms, organized it in Google Sheets, and applied formulas to calculate fuel efficiency and overall costs. We visualized the results using charts and graphs, which clearly showed which gas stations (e.g., Shell, Sinclair, Circle K) and car models (e.g., Honda Insight vs. Honda CR-V) offered the most cost-effective options. </p>

                <ul> 
                    <li> Built a dynamic spreadsheet model to calculate MPG and total fuel costs. </li>
                    <li> Conducted comparative analysis of gas prices across multiple companies. </li>
                    <li> Designed data visualizations to present findings clearly and persuasively. </li> 
                    <li> Collaborated in a team project setting, dividing tasks and integrating results. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 style="font-style: sans-serif;"> HCI Needfinding Project </h2>
                <p> As part of my Human–Computer Interaction coursework, my team conducted a needfinding study to better understand user challenges and opportunities for design. We interviewed participants from diverse backgrounds to uncover their goals, frustrations, and behaviors with everyday tools and technologies. Through open-ended questions and observation, we identified recurring themes and unmet needs. </p>

                <p> We then synthesized these findings into user insights that highlight practical design opportunities, such as improving usability, accessibility, and efficiency in digital interactions. This project enhanced my skills in user research, interview techniques, and qualitative analysis, while reinforcing the importance of empathy and user-centered design in building effective technology solutions. </p>

                <h2 style="font-style: sans-serif;"> "NextGen Technical Support" Project</h2>
                <p> Shortly after graduating from school in Afghanistan, I collaborated with two peers to launch Wherever You Are, Be Educated, an educational initiative fully funded by our own resources. The project aimed to provide free technology education for students aged 12–18, helping bridge the digital gap for young learners. </p>
                <p> We designed and delivered both in-person and online classes covering: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Computer Fundamentals </li>
                    <li> Netoworking Basics </li>
                    <li> Microsoft Office tools </li>
                    <li> Hands-on Tutorials </li>
                </ul>

                <p> This initiative not only empowered students with essential digital skills but also strengthened my abilities in team collaboration, curriculum development, and community impact. This was being awarded and recognized by <b> Ashiana NGO, Iran Embassy</b> on 2019 "For innovation in Remote Learning" out of 50 project submission. </p>
