            		<h1 style="color: blue;"> 📡 The bits and Bytes of Networking 📡 | Issued: 2025 </h1>
            		<ul> <li> <p> The OSI Model plays a crucial role in understanding how data is transmitted across networks. Network Infrastructure provides the foundation for communication, while Network Security ensures protection against threats and unauthorized access. Network Routing determines the best path for data to travel, and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) simplifies IP address management. Wireless Networks enable flexible connectivity, while Data Integrity ensures accuracy and consistency of information. Computer Networking connects systems for sharing resources, and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) offer secure remote access. Network Architecture defines the overall design of a network, while TCP/IP remains the fundamental protocol suite for communication. Together, these Network Protocols create a reliable, secure, and efficient communication system. </p> </li> </ul>
